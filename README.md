# Managed Kubernetes Auditing Toolkit (MKAT)

**Note**: At this time (pre-release), this is highly beta.

## Building

```bash
make
./mkat --help
```

## Usage

For now, please refer to the autogenerated CLI documentation in (docs)[./docs]. Pre-requisites:

* You need to be authenticated against an EKS cluster
* For find-role-relationships, you also need to be authenticated against the same AWS account as where the EKS cluster is running

## Vision tl;dr

* We show cloud-specific risks, not generic ones
* We only show effective risk, not "potential" / graph-based risk
